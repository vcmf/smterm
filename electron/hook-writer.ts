// File-drop hook transport. Instead of POSTing to a loopback HTTP server (unreachable
// from WSL, and a source of stale-port ECONNREFUSED spam), Claude runs a `command` hook
// that writes each event's stdin JSON verbatim into a watched directory; smterm's watcher
// (agent-hooks.ts) reads + deletes each file. No ports, no networking — works identically
// on macOS, native Windows, and WSL (which writes into a Windows dir via /mnt/c).

// Inline `node -e` (exec form) so there's no separate script file to relocate for WSL —
// `node` is always present where `claude` runs. Reads stdin, writes one uniquely-named
// file per event into argv[1]; the filename is prefixed with SMTERM_PANE_ID so the watcher
// can tag which pane the event came from (the payload itself has no pane id).
