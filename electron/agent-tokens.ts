 * path to reachable host paths (WSL translation); state stays keyed by the reported path.
 *
 * Caveats (both eventually-consistent / graceful, documented for reviewers):
 *   - The transcript is written asynchronously and may lag the in-memory conversation, so a
 *     read on Stop can miss the just-ended turn's last line → the total trails by up to a turn
 *     and self-heals on the next Stop (a sub-agent stops once, so its badge may sit one turn low).
 *   - TokenUsage is emitted as a follow-up batch after the hook events; if a later
 *     UserPromptSubmit prunes a finished sub-agent before its (slow) read lands, the reducer's
 *     no-resurrection guard drops it and no badge appears. Narrow — sub-agent transcripts are
 *     small so the read is fast; the session root is never pruned, only evicted on SessionEnd. */
