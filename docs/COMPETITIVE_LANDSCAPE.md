# Competitive Landscape — smterm

> Who else is building "run and watch a fleet of coding agents," how they differ, and where
> smterm's wedge is. Companion to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (design) and `ROADMAP.md` (progress).

Status: **living doc** — the space moves fast (tools rename, companies fold). Snapshot as of
**2026-07-06**; re-verify names/status before citing (see §6 for known traps).

> **Verification:** the facts in §3 (stacks, licenses, isolation models, status) were checked via a
> multi-source, adversarially-verified deep-research pass on **2026-07-07** — 21 primary/secondary
> sources, 25 claims put through 3-vote verification (23 confirmed, 2 refuted). Refuted claims and
> known gaps are called out in §6. Findings rest on project READMEs / official vendor docs.

## 1. The convergence thesis

Independently, from different starting points, a whole category converged on the same idea in
2025–2026: **a surface for running multiple coding agents in parallel and watching their status.**

- IDEs pivoted toward it — **Cursor 2/3** made an "agent-first" view the default; **VS Code**
  shipped a built-in **Agent Sessions** sidebar (model-agnostic: Claude, Codex, Copilot).
- A crop of standalone tools appeared — terminals, desktop apps, and kanban boards — all solving
  the same two problems:
  1. **Isolation** so parallel agents don't clobber each other's files → almost universally
     **git worktrees** (a few use containers).
  2. **A unified view** of every session's status (running / waiting / done).

So "a dashboard over agents" is now **table stakes, not a differentiator.** The differentiation is
in _form factor_, _cross-platform reach_, _agent-agnosticism_, and _execution quality_ (§4–§5).

---

## 2. The map: two axes

Every tool sits on two axes. This is the useful mental model.

```
                     SURFACE
   terminal-native ◄──────────────────► GUI board / IDE
        │                                     │
        │  cmux, ccmanager,        Conductor, Nimbalyst,
        │  Claude Squad, dmux,     Vibe Kanban, Cursor,
        │  Superset, Paneflow,     VS Code Agent Sessions
        │  amux                    Sculptor
        │
   ─────┼───────────────────────────────────────────  ISOLATION
        │  worktrees (almost everyone)  │  containers (Sculptor)
```

- **Surface** — is the primary object a _terminal/PTY_, or a _board / diff-review GUI_?
- **Isolation** — **git worktree per agent** is the default substrate; **containers** are the
  heavier-isolation outlier.

Crowded corners: **macOS-native terminal** (cmux, Conductor, Paneflow) and **web/kanban boards**
(Vibe Kanban, Nimbalyst). Thin corner → smterm's opening (§5).

---

## 3. The field, by form factor

> **⚠️ Name collision — two different "cmux":**
>
> - **cmux (Manaflow)** — the famous native macOS Ghostty terminal (3a below). GPL/AGPL, YC S24.
> - **cmux (`craigsc/cmux`)** — an unrelated ~560-line **pure-bash** CLI, "tmux for Claude Code":
>   fans a fleet of Claude agents across git worktrees on one repo. Different project, different scale.
>
> When anyone says "cmux," disambiguate which. This doc's "cmux" = Manaflow's unless noted.

## 4. Lessons from competitors' criticism (design constraints for us)

The _idea_ is validated everywhere; execution keeps failing on the **same two things**. These are
free lessons — bake them into smterm's design (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8, §9).

1. **Respect the primary surface.** Cursor's loudest complaint: the agent/chat chrome _"take[s]
   space more than the actual code."_ → For us the **terminal (PTY) must stay the star**; status is
   ambient badges, not a giant panel that eats the shell.
2. **Respect the keyboard — and let users remap.** Both **cmux** (keyboard shortcuts break after
   opening/closing browser tabs) and **Cursor** (layout shortcuts conflict with custom bindings,
   _not reconfigurable_) drew blood here. → **User-configurable keybindings from v1**; never hijack
   a combo the user can't rebind.
3. **Native ≠ automatically fast or bug-free.** cmux went native explicitly citing perf/input, yet
   ships **laggy scrolling, higher CPU than plain Ghostty**, and input bugs. → Stack choice isn't
   the quality lever; **execution is.** Reassures the Tauri decision (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §3).
4. **Make the escape hatch discoverable.** Cursor's "Classic Editor" existed but users had to be
   _told_ by a moderator. → Any mode/layout switch must be obvious.
5. **Persistence & remote are real gaps users hit.** cmux is **macOS-only with no detach/reattach**
   → "doesn't work on remote terminals." → Our answer is deliberate (`ARCHITECTURE.md` Appendix A):
   local daemon later; **wrap the remote's `tmux`/`mosh`** rather than shipping a remote daemon.

## 5. smterm's positioning (the wedge)

Against the map in §2, the thin/open corner is:

> **Genuinely cross-platform (macOS · Linux · Windows · WSL) · terminal-native with real PTYs ·
> lightweight · agent-agnostic.**

How we compare to the two poles we're threading between:

| Dimension                 | cmux                          | ccmanager               | **smterm (target)**                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Surface                   | Native GPU terminal           | TUI (inside a terminal) | GUI terminal (Tauri + xterm.js)        |
| Platforms                 | macOS only                    | Cross-platform          | **mac · Linux · Windows · WSL**        |
| Agent-agnostic            | Yes (runs any CLI)            | **Yes, broadest**       | Yes (any PTY program)                  |
| Footprint                 | Native, but heavy in practice | Tiny (TUI)              | **Small (Tauri, not Electron)**        |
| Native polish             | **Highest**                   | n/a (TUI)               | Mid (webview)                          |
| Notifications / attention | Yes                           | Limited                 | **Headline feature** (OSC 9 / OSC 133) |
| Split panes + tabs GUI    | Yes                           | Limited (TUI)           | **Yes, v1**                            |
| Persistence / reattach    | ❌                            | Via tmux                | Planned (Appendix A)                   |

**Honest read of the competition:**

- **cmux** beats us on native polish but is **macOS-only** — its cross-platform ports are separate
  projects (wmux/Electron, Paneflow/GPUI). One codebase across four targets is our structural edge.
- **ccmanager** is the closest on _agent breadth + cross-platform_, but it's a **TUI** — no native
  GUI tabs/panes, weaker notifications, no OS-native toasts. Our GUI + native notifications is the
  differentiator there.
- **Board tools** (Vibe Kanban, Nimbalyst, Conductor) optimize for _review/PR/kanban_. We optimize
  for **watching live terminals** — a different job. Not a direct fight; a different surface.

**What is NOT a differentiator (don't sell these):** "a view over agents," "worktree isolation,"
"parallel agents." Everyone has them. Our story is **reach + terminal-native + weight + attention
signals**, not the fleet concept itself.

## 6. Naming & status traps, and refuted claims (verify before citing)

**Traps:**

- **"cmux" is two projects** — Manaflow's native macOS terminal vs `craigsc/cmux`'s bash script.
  Always disambiguate (see the collision note above §3a).
- **Crystal → Nimbalyst** — renamed; old repo says "Crystal is now Nimbalyst" (deprecated 2026-02-26).
- **Vibe Kanban** — company **BloopAI sunsetting ~2026-04-10** ("couldn't find a business model");
  project continues as Apache-2.0 community-maintained. Alive as OSS, dead as a company.
- **Sculptor** — isolates with **containers**, not worktrees (see refuted claim below). Often listed
  loosely as an "orchestrator" but is a container-based parallel-agent desktop app.

**Refuted in the 2026-07-07 verification (do NOT rely on these):**

- ✗ "cmux (Manaflow) supports only Claude Code" — refuted 1-2. Its multi-agent breadth is genuinely
  uncertain; don't state it either way without checking the current repo.
- ✗ "Sculptor uses git worktrees as primary isolation" — refuted 0-3. It uses **containers**.

**Gaps (named in the question but not verifiable this pass):** amux, Superset, Paneflow, wmux
returned no surviving claims — treat their rows in §3a as provisional until re-verified.

The category is churny — assume any tool here may have renamed, changed license, or folded since this
snapshot. The two directories in §3e are the freshest trackers.
