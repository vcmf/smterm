# Gotchas — smterm

The non-obvious traps, with the _why_. CLAUDE.md carries a one-line flag for each of
these; this file is the detail you read when one bites. See also `ARCHITECTURE.md`
(design) and `TESTING.md` (quality bar).

## Renderer ↔ main seam {#seam}

Renderer talks to main **only via `src/lib/ipc.ts`** (preload exposes it as
`window.smterm`). Don't import Electron in React. This one seam is also the insulation
point for the out-of-process session daemon (ARCHITECTURE Appendix A).

Terminals live in **`terminal/terminal-manager.ts`, OUTSIDE the React tree**, keyed by
session id — so splitting a pane or switching tabs **re-attaches** instead of respawning
the shell. Dispose a terminal only when its session leaves the store.

## Fonts & ligatures {#fonts}

Terminal fonts must be **bundled `@font-face`** (`public/fonts/`): the WebGL renderer
needs the primary font to carry Nerd/Powerline icons (no per-glyph fallback). The WebGL
atlas rasterizes glyphs via canvas, which only uses an `@font-face` **after it's
explicitly loaded** — `document.fonts.ready` is not enough (see `ensureFontLoaded`).

Ligatures need `allowProposedApi` + the character joiner (works on WebGL, not the DOM
renderer). Default is **off** (`font.ligatures: false`) — WebGL + the ligature joiner
can leave paint remnants (xterm.js #3303), worse with multiple panes.

## Renderer policy: WebGL only for on-screen panes {#renderer}

Many simultaneous WebGL contexts **corrupt the glyph atlas** (garbled text — xterm.js
#4379/#3303, still unsolved upstream; browsers also cap live contexts and evict the oldest).
Creating a context disturbs the siblings that share xterm's atlas — that's the garble that hit
the untouched panes when you split a tab full of agent TUIs. **The cure is an atlas rebuild after
the pane set changes:** when `reconcileRenderers` creates a context **and** >1 will coexist, it
schedules `repairRenderers(true)` on the next frame (`clearTextureAtlas()` + repaint on **all**
live WebGL panes), so any glyphs the new context disturbed re-rasterize cleanly. With that in
place, every visible pane can run WebGL crisply — the same shared-atlas approach VS Code uses.
`acquireWebgl` returns whether it created a context so the reconcile knows when to rebuild.

The `renderer` setting (`lib/renderer-policy.ts` `webglPanes`, pure + tested):

- **`webgl`** (default) — WebGL on every visible pane.
- **`dom`** — no GPU anywhere; always correct, a bit slower. The fallback for GPUs/drivers that
  can't hold multiple contexts cleanly (VS Code keeps `gpuAcceleration: off` for the same reason;
  it still ships occasional multi-terminal glitches — vscode#237688).

`reconcileRenderers` runs on tab-switch / split / close (app.tsx) + attach + settings change.

**Keep `customGlyphs` on (the default).** It makes the WebGL renderer draw box-drawing/Powerline
glyphs with its own crisp, grid-aligned geometry rather than from the font. Turning it off makes
those glyphs look plainer (that's all the DOM renderer can ever do — it has no custom-glyph path,
which is why `dom` mode looks less sharp).

**Compositing changes on the `.terminal-pane` container can garble the child WebGL canvas**
(`box-shadow`/`transform`/opacity, animated _or_ just toggled). The focus/attention rail
toggles `box-shadow` on `.terminal-pane` (`App.css` `.focused`/`.waiting`) — including on
split and on every agent status flip — so we **isolate the canvas into its own layer** via
`contain: paint; isolation: isolate;` on `.terminal-mount`, which stops the parent recomposite
from touching it. If you add new per-pane cues, still prefer a non-compositing indicator over
new effects on `.terminal-pane`. Renderer stays WebGL (VS Code's choice; xterm's canvas addon
is deprecated).

**Reparenting the canvas needs a repaint.** Splitting a pane remounts its `TerminalPane`, so
`attach()` moves the live WebGL host into the new container — which shows stale pixels until the
next draw. `attach()` ends with `requestAnimationFrame(() => repairRenderers())` to repaint the
moved canvas.

**The atlas/framebuffer can also go stale on its own** — after the app is backgrounded,
a display-scale/monitor (DPR) change, or a resize — showing garble until a scroll forces a
repaint. `terminal-manager.repairRenderers(rebuildAtlas?)` automates that scroll: `app.tsx`
calls it on window focus and `visibilitychange` (cheap repaint), and on a DPR change or a
debounced resize (`rebuildAtlas=true` → `clearTextureAtlas()`, since glyph metrics moved).
True _context loss_ is separate (see `acquireWebgl`): it disposes and stays on the DOM.

## Self-heal a crashed TUI's mouse mode {#mouse-reset}

A full-screen TUI killed abnormally (classic case: an agent dying on lid-close/sleep)
never restores the mouse-tracking modes it enabled, so afterwards every mouse move
floods the prompt with raw SGR reports (`35;70;25M…`). Our zsh/bash `precmd`
(`electron/shell-integration.ts`) emits the mouse-mode disables (`\e[?1000/1002/1003/
1006 l`) every prompt, so the terminal self-heals the instant control returns to the
shell — safe there since no full-screen program is running. Only heals in shells with
our integration (zsh/bash); plain PowerShell/cmd/fish won't self-heal.

## Sessions, cwd & PTY lifetime {#session-survival}

**cwd tracking is OSC-7-based.** `session.cwd` is set only when the shell emits OSC 7
(our zsh/bash integration does, from `precmd`). It drives the **git diff panel** and
**cwd inheritance** (splits + new tabs open in the focused terminal's dir). Shells that
don't emit OSC 7 (plain PowerShell/cmd, or before the first prompt) have no cwd → the
diff panel is empty and new panes fall back to `$HOME`. Not a bug — graceful degradation.

**Layout is persisted, processes are not — across a full quit.** The tab/pane tree +
each pane's `{command,args,cwd}` are saved (debounced) to `~/.config/smterm/
workspace.json` and restored on launch (VS Code-style: fresh shells respawn in the saved
cwds; scrollback/running programs are gone).

**But PTYs survive a renderer reload (sleep/dev-HMR/GPU-crash).** PTYs live in the main
process, which outlives a renderer reload. `pty:spawn` is **attach-or-spawn**: a spawn
for an already-live session id **reattaches** — main rebinds output to the new renderer,
resizes, and replays recent history from a bounded per-session `OutputBuffer` — instead
of respawning and orphaning the live shell. Diagnosed via `electron/diagnostics.ts`
(a lid-close showed suspend→resume with no app reboot, only a renderer reload). Explicit
`pty:kill` (pane/tab close) still truly terminates + frees the buffer.

**True reattach across a full app quit** (live processes surviving a quit, via a detached
daemon) is still **ROADMAP M5** — a full quit kills PTYs (they're children of main +
`killAllPtys()`). See ARCHITECTURE Appendix A.

**Quit is guarded.** `before-quit` shows a native confirm dialog when PTYs are live
(unless `settings.confirmQuit` is false); the frameless close button routes through
`app.quit()` too. The dialog's "don't warn again" writes `confirmQuit:false` to
settings.json.

## zsh/bash history is shared across panes (cmux-like) {#history}

**Fixed 2026-07-10.** Symptom was: unlike cmux, smterm panes didn't share command history
live (type in pane A, reuse in pane B) and history often didn't survive closing the app —
even with the user's `HISTFILE`/`HISTSIZE`/`SAVEHIST` set (so `.zshrc` **was** loading;
never an rc-loading problem). Root cause: our injected integration didn't enable shared
history, while cmux does (confirmed — `setopt | grep -i sharehistory` returns `sharehistory`
in a cmux pane with the user's `.zshrc` having it off, so cmux enables it itself).

**Fix (in `electron/shell-integration.ts`):**

- **zsh:** after sourcing the user's `.zshrc` (so it wins), `setopt SHARE_HISTORY` + sane
  `HISTFILE`/`SAVEHIST`/`HISTSIZE` fallbacks **only when unset**.
- **bash:** `shopt -s histappend` + `history -a; history -n` in `__smterm_precmd` (after
  `local ret=$?` so it can't clobber the reported exit code).
- **Why it also fixes persistence:** `SHARE_HISTORY`/`histappend` write each command to
  `HISTFILE` **immediately**, so history survives even the hard `proc.kill()` on close — we
  did **not** need to touch the PTY kill/reattach lifecycle (which session-survival depends
  on). Graceful shutdown would be a nice-to-have but is unnecessary for history.
- **Opt-out:** it's an opinionated semantics change (cross-pane chronological interleave vs
  per-session order), so it's gated on `SMTERM_SHARE_HISTORY` (default on). The
  `shareHistory` setting (schema, default `true`) → `main.ts` sets `SMTERM_SHARE_HISTORY=0`
  in the spawn env when off; `wslInjection` lists the var in `$WSLENV` so the opt-out
  crosses into WSL.
- **Invariant:** all panes must keep the **same `HISTFILE`** — the injection must never set
  a per-pane histfile, or sharing breaks.
- **ZDOTDIR poisons `HISTFILE` (fixed 2026-07-15).** We inject `ZDOTDIR=<temp>` to load our
  rc, but a **system zshrc runs before our rc** and (macOS `/etc/zshrc`, some Linux) does
  `HISTFILE=${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zsh_history` — pointing `HISTFILE` into our **temp** dir.
  Result: smterm panes shared history **with each other** (same temp file) but were **siloed
  from every other terminal** (vscode/cmux/Terminal, which use `$HOME/.zsh_history`). Fix: our
  rc repoints `HISTFILE` whenever it landed **inside** our injected dir (`"$HISTFILE" ==
"$SMTERM_ZDOTDIR"/*`, guarded by `-n "$SMTERM_ZDOTDIR"`), keeping the basename →
  `${SMTERM_USER_ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/${HISTFILE:t}` (so it matches whatever file other terminals
  use; never a `HISTFILE` the user set elsewhere on purpose). Runs even when shared-history is
  opted out — a file-location correctness fix, not a sharing opt-in. **Cross-platform:** local
  zsh (macOS/Linux) sets `SMTERM_ZDOTDIR` via `buildInjection`; **WSL** sets it in
  `wslInjection` and forwards it over `$WSLENV`, so the repoint fires there too. bash is
  unaffected (no ZDOTDIR).

## node-pty is a native module {#node-pty}

After install / Electron upgrades run `npx electron-rebuild -o node-pty` (in
`make install`). Vitest can't load it (Electron ABI), so PTY spawning isn't unit-tested
there — push logic into pure modules (`output-buffer`, `coalescer`, shell-integration
parsers) and test those; verify the PTY path manually / via the diagnostics log.

## GUI launch has a bare PATH — import the login-shell env {#shell-env}

A macOS/Linux app launched from Finder/Dock inherits a minimal `launchd` PATH
(`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`), **not** the user's shell PATH — so Homebrew/cargo
tools (`starship`, etc.) are missing and `.zshrc` lines like `starship init` fail with
"command not found". Only bites the **packaged** app; `npm run dev` is launched from a
terminal that already has the full env. Fix (`electron/shell-env.ts`, VS Code's approach):
on startup, when `app.isPackaged` and not Windows, run the login+interactive shell once,
capture its env, and import PATH (+ missing vars) into `process.env` before any PTY
spawns. Parser is pure + tested; the shell probe is best-effort (returns `{}` on failure).

## Windows {#windows}

The app spawns `wsl.exe` as a shell — it never runs _inside_ WSL.

**Git for a WSL session runs _inside_ the distro, not on the host.** A WSL pane's cwd
(from OSC 7) is a Linux path (`/home/you/repo`) the Windows host can't see, so host `git`
reports "not a git repo" and the diff panel is empty. Fix: the renderer passes the session's
WSL context (`lib/wsl.ts` `wslContext` → `{ distro }`, parsed from the `wsl.exe -d <distro>`
command) with `git:status`/`git:diff`; `electron/git.ts` then runs `wsl.exe [-d <distro>]
--cd <cwd> -- git …` (see `wslGitArgs`). The untracked-file line-count fallback (`countLines`,
host fs) and the diff null-device (`NUL` vs `/dev/null`) are also WSL-aware.

## Clickable file links {#file-links}

Path-like tokens in output are made clickable (click → open in editor / reveal). A **plain click**
opens in normal output, but while a full-screen TUI holds **mouse tracking** (Claude's live UI, vim
— `term.modes.mouseTrackingMode`) a bare click belongs to the app, so there it needs **Cmd/Ctrl-click**
(same as VS Code) — otherwise clicks inside the agent's UI would get hijacked into opening files.
Detection is a **permissive regex on purpose** (`lib/file-links.ts`, pure + tested) — the real false-positive
filter is **existence validation** (`fs:path-exists`, `main`) against the session cwd, so a version
string like `1.2.3` or a domain that doesn't resolve to a file never underlines. Validation is
cached in `terminal-manager` (the link provider fires on hover, not per render). Clicking runs the
`openPath` template (default `code -g {file}:{line}:{col}`, found via the login-shell PATH from
`shell-env` so a packaged app can locate `code`); it falls back to the OS default (`shell.openPath`)
when the template is empty or the editor binary isn't found. **Known limits (follow-ups):** single
row only (a path wrapped across rows isn't matched); forward-slash paths (no Windows-native
backslash); extensionless files (`Makefile`) unless they contain a slash; **WSL** panes don't open
links yet (needs the WSL cwd context — see `#windows` / the WSL git PR).

## Hidden terminals are parked, not hidden {#hidden-terminals}

A pane holds several terminals (surfaces) but mounts only the visible one. Every other
**started** terminal — a hidden surface, a background tab you've visited — is **parked**: its
xterm is opened inside an off-screen, `inert` element in the document (`parkingLot()` in
`terminal-manager.ts`). `detach()` parks; `attach()` moves the host back; `ensureRunning()`
starts a pane's hidden surfaces straight into the lot. The invariant: **once started, a
terminal is mounted or parked — never unopened**, and never disposed on unmount (only when its
session leaves the store).

Starting is **lazy per tab**: only the active tab's `PaneLayout` renders, so after a restore or
a renderer reload a background tab's terminals have no xterm entry (and, after a full quit, no
PTY) until the tab is first shown — no status, notifications or cwd from them before that.
Code must tolerate a missing entry (e.g. `dispose()` still kills the PTY by id).

Why not the obvious alternatives:

- **Unopened until shown** (the first design): an unopened xterm has no theme service, so it
  never answers OSC 10/11 colour queries (agents pick the wrong light/dark), and
  `registerCharacterJoiner` throws "Terminal must be opened first" — with ligatures on, any
  settings change crashed the app.
- **`visibility:hidden` inside the pane:** xterm pauses rendering via an IntersectionObserver,
  which ignores `visibility`, so every hidden terminal would keep painting its output — a
  hot-path cost per surface. Off-viewport parking gets the pause for free.

Parked terminals can't measure themselves: they take their pane's grid via `followSize`
(`syncHiddenSizes` on pane resize / font change), resizing the PTY only when the grid really
changes. WebGL is never acquired while parked (`acquireWebgl` checks the host's parent) — a live
canvas that gets reparented can lose its context. Keyboard focus follows the store's focus:
`attach()` only focuses the tab's focused session, never whatever just mounted.

## Theme on first paint {#first-paint-theme}

`settings.json` loads asynchronously, but a light theme must not flash the dark CSS defaults.
Three pieces, all needed:

1. **`index.html` inline script** applies the last theme's CSS vars (localStorage
   `smterm:theme-vars`, written by `applyThemeVars`) before first paint. Doing it in
   `main.tsx` is too late — module scripts are deferred.
2. **The theme effect waits for `settingsLoaded`** — running once with defaults would
   overwrite the cache with dark. Settings also load _before_ the workspace restore, so
   restored panes spawn with the right `COLORFGBG`.
3. **The native window background** (`window:set-background`) follows the theme and is saved to
   `window-bg` in the config dir, so the next launch's `BrowserWindow` opens light.

A running shell's env can't change, so `COLORFGBG` is stale for panes opened before a
light/dark switch (incl. `appearance: "system"` following the OS); native shells get the live
answer via xterm's OSC 11 reply.

## Claude Code integration reads internal formats {#claude-transcript}

Hook payloads and the session transcript JSONL are **undocumented Claude internals** — parse
best-effort and ignore what you don't recognize; never throw (`transcript-fold.ts` and friends).

- `/color` and `/rename` are recorded **only** in the transcript
  (`{"type":"agent-color","agentColor":"orange"}`, `{"type":"custom-title","customTitle":"…"}`,
  latest wins, `default` = reset). Claude sends no terminal escape for either, and **slash
  commands fire no hook** — `agent-meta.ts` finds the transcript via the pane's hook events,
  then `fs.watch`es that one file. `/rename` never sets a colour in Claude itself; the
  name-derived colour is smterm's (cmux does the same).
- The transcript is read incrementally in bounded chunks (`TranscriptFold`) — a resumed session
  can be 90 MB+, and a synchronous parse would stall PTY forwarding.
- Hook-event drops are ingested **unordered**: a late `SessionEnd` of the previous session in a
  pane must not stop tracking the new one (compare the transcript path).

## Resuming Claude sessions on relaunch {#resume}

`electron/agent-sessions.ts` keeps a ledger (`agent-sessions.json`) of which Claude session
each terminal is inside, from the `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` hooks. On relaunch the
renderer asks for a plan **before** restoring the workspace (so the shell spawns in the
session's own cwd — `claude --resume <id>` only finds transcripts of the current project dir),
and `terminal-manager` types `claude --resume <id> [--permission-mode m]` at the first prompt.

- **Any `SessionEnd` while smterm runs clears the entry** — double Ctrl-C can report reason
  `other`, so reasons can't tell "user quit Claude" from anything else. Only a quit (the ledger
  is **frozen and flushed before** `killAllPtys`, whose kills would fire SessionEnds) or a
  crash (no SessionEnd at all; the ledger is write-through) leaves entries to resume.
- **Live PTYs are skipped** — after a renderer reload Claude is still running.
- **One shot:** the entry is consumed on **failure or dismiss** — not when typed (a quit or
  crash during the confirmation window must still resume next time); a failure shows the
  banner, never a retry loop. Main only consumes the exact carried-over entry, so a late
  success that re-recorded it this run is kept. Failure = a `D` that follows our command's own `C` (it exited — the code is in the
  `D` payload; a `D` without a `C` is just the shell's first prompt arriving late) before
  Claude's `SessionStart`, or 25 s passing. A later success still wins.
- The command is typed from **validated** parts only (UUID id, one-word mode):
  bypassPermissions is dropped unless `resumeBypassPermissions` is on.
- Background tabs start lazily, so their entries wait (across quits) until first shown.
- Only shells that take POSIX quoting get the typed `cd -- '…' &&` (zsh/bash/sh/dash/ksh, WSL);
  fish, pwsh, cmd and others spawn in the session's dir instead. Typing waits for a real
  prompt on shells main reports as integrated (never guessed from the name).
- Known limit: Ctrl-Z a Claude, then start a second one in the same pane — the second is
  treated as nested (not recorded), so a relaunch offers the first. When the second exits, the
  returning prompt also drops the suspended one from the agents board + Claude icon (a prompt
  can't tell which Claude ended); its next hook event brings it back.
- A shell **without** integration (e.g. a cold WSL VM whose injection timed out) can't confirm
  a resume — no hooks, no OSC 133 — so after typing the banner only says it was **sent**; it
  never reports failure or offers buttons that would type into a possibly-running Claude.
- Known limit: vi-mode users in **normal** mode — ^U doesn't clear the line there, so a banner
  button's keystrokes are read as vi commands. Stay in insert mode (the default) to use them.
- **rc-time commands are fine** (`conda activate`, nvm, direnv in `.zshrc`): the first `D` only
  comes after the whole rc ran, so the resume runs inside that environment. Two known limits:
  an rc that hands the terminal over (`exec tmux`, `exec fish`, auto-ssh) never shows our
  prompt, so after 20 s the banner only offers Resume (it won't type into tmux); and only the
  session's **folder** is restored, not its **environment** — a hand-run `conda activate ml` /
  venv comes back as whatever the rc activates (could record `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` /
  `VIRTUAL_ENV` from the hook process's env, if it ever matters).
- **Delivery by typing is deliberate — revisit only if a shell becomes a pain point.**
  Alternatives weighed (2026-09): (a) the integration runs `SMTERM_RESUME_ID` at the first
  prompt — nothing typed, but native only on zsh; (b) spawn the pane as
  `$SHELL -ic 'claude --resume X; exec $SHELL -i'` — no typing, fixes fish/pwsh quoting, but
  the rc runs twice, no history entry, weaker job control, and no prompt marks to detect a
  failed resume; (c) `claude --continue` — picks the wrong session when two panes share a
  repo. None handles an rc that execs tmux. If fish/pwsh users hit problems, (b) per shell
  is the candidate.

## Agent-status reducer has a known flaw {#agent-status}

`lib/session-status.ts`: `running` = OSC-133 C..D (process alive) ≠ actively working, so
interactive agents read "running" while waiting, and revisiting a pane can re-notify.
Don't quick-patch it — the planned activity-based + latched rewrite needs a real test
matrix. See ARCHITECTURE §9a + ROADMAP M3.6 Track C.
