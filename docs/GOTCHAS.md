# Gotchas — minmux

The non-obvious traps, with the _why_. CLAUDE.md carries a one-line flag for each of
these; this file is the detail you read when one bites. See also `ARCHITECTURE.md`
(design) and `TESTING.md` (quality bar).

## Renderer ↔ main seam {#seam}

Renderer talks to main **only via `src/lib/ipc.ts`** (preload exposes it as
`window.minmux`). Don't import Electron in React. This one seam is also the insulation
point for the out-of-process session daemon (ARCHITECTURE Appendix A).

Terminals live in **`terminal/terminal-manager.ts`, OUTSIDE the React tree**, keyed by
session id — so splitting a pane or switching tabs **re-attaches** instead of respawning
the shell. Dispose a terminal only when its session leaves the store.

## Fonts & ligatures {#fonts}

Terminal fonts must be **bundled `@font-face`** (`public/fonts/`): the WebGL renderer
needs the primary font to carry Nerd/Powerline icons (no per-glyph fallback). The WebGL
atlas rasterizes glyphs via canvas, which only uses an `@font-face` **after it's
explicitly loaded** — `document.fonts.ready` is not enough (see `ensureFontLoaded`).

Ligatures need `allowProposedApi` + the character joiner (works on WebGL, not the DOM
renderer). Default is **off** (`font.ligatures: false`) — WebGL + the ligature joiner
can leave paint remnants (xterm.js #3303), worse with multiple panes.

## Renderer policy: WebGL only for on-screen panes {#renderer}

Many simultaneous WebGL contexts **corrupt the glyph atlas** (garbled text — xterm.js
#4379/#3303, still unsolved upstream; browsers also cap live contexts and evict the oldest).
Creating a context disturbs the siblings that share xterm's atlas — that's the garble that hit
the untouched panes when you split a tab full of agent TUIs. **The cure is an atlas rebuild after
the pane set changes:** when `reconcileRenderers` creates a context **and** >1 will coexist, it
schedules `repairRenderers(true)` on the next frame (`clearTextureAtlas()` + repaint on **all**
live WebGL panes), so any glyphs the new context disturbed re-rasterize cleanly. With that in
place, every visible pane can run WebGL crisply — the same shared-atlas approach VS Code uses.
`acquireWebgl` returns whether it created a context so the reconcile knows when to rebuild.

The `renderer` setting (`lib/renderer-policy.ts` `webglPanes`, pure + tested):

- **`webgl`** (default) — WebGL on every visible pane.
- **`dom`** — no GPU anywhere; always correct, a bit slower. The fallback for GPUs/drivers that
  can't hold multiple contexts cleanly (VS Code keeps `gpuAcceleration: off` for the same reason;
  it still ships occasional multi-terminal glitches — vscode#237688).

`reconcileRenderers` runs on tab-switch / split / close (app.tsx) + attach + settings change.

**Keep `customGlyphs` on (the default).** It makes the WebGL renderer draw box-drawing/Powerline
glyphs with its own crisp, grid-aligned geometry rather than from the font. Turning it off makes
those glyphs look plainer (that's all the DOM renderer can ever do — it has no custom-glyph path,
which is why `dom` mode looks less sharp).

**Compositing changes on the `.terminal-pane` container can garble the child WebGL canvas**
(`box-shadow`/`transform`/opacity, animated _or_ just toggled). The focus/attention rail
toggles `box-shadow` on `.terminal-pane` (`App.css` `.focused`/`.waiting`) — including on
split and on every agent status flip — so we **isolate the canvas into its own layer** via
`contain: paint; isolation: isolate;` on `.terminal-mount`, which stops the parent recomposite
from touching it. If you add new per-pane cues, still prefer a non-compositing indicator over
new effects on `.terminal-pane`. Renderer stays WebGL (VS Code's choice; xterm's canvas addon
is deprecated).

**Reparenting the canvas needs a repaint.** Splitting a pane remounts its `TerminalPane`, so
`attach()` moves the live WebGL host into the new container — which shows stale pixels until the
next draw. `attach()` ends with `requestAnimationFrame(() => repairRenderers())` to repaint the
moved canvas.

**The atlas/framebuffer can also go stale on its own** — after the app is backgrounded,
a display-scale/monitor (DPR) change, or a resize — showing garble until a scroll forces a
repaint. `terminal-manager.repairRenderers(rebuildAtlas?)` automates that scroll: `app.tsx`
calls it on window focus and `visibilitychange` (cheap repaint), and on a DPR change or a
debounced resize (`rebuildAtlas=true` → `clearTextureAtlas()`, since glyph metrics moved).
True _context loss_ is separate (see `acquireWebgl`): it disposes and stays on the DOM.

## Self-heal a crashed TUI's mouse mode {#mouse-reset}

A full-screen TUI killed abnormally (classic case: an agent dying on lid-close/sleep)
never restores the mouse-tracking modes it enabled, so afterwards every mouse move
floods the prompt with raw SGR reports (`35;70;25M…`). Our zsh/bash `precmd`
(`electron/shell-integration.ts`) emits the mouse-mode disables (`\e[?1000/1002/1003/
1006 l`) every prompt, so the terminal self-heals the instant control returns to the
shell — safe there since no full-screen program is running. Only heals in shells with
our integration (zsh/bash); plain PowerShell/cmd/fish won't self-heal.

## Sessions, cwd & PTY lifetime {#session-survival}

**cwd tracking is OSC-7-based.** `session.cwd` is set only when the shell emits OSC 7
(our zsh/bash integration does, from `precmd`). It drives the **git diff panel** and
**cwd inheritance** (splits + new tabs open in the focused terminal's dir). Shells that
don't emit OSC 7 (plain PowerShell/cmd, or before the first prompt) have no cwd → the
diff panel is empty and new panes fall back to `$HOME`. Not a bug — graceful degradation.

**Layout is persisted, processes are not — across a full quit.** The tab/pane tree +
each pane's `{command,args,cwd}` are saved (debounced) to `~/.config/minmux/
workspace.json` and restored on launch (VS Code-style: fresh shells respawn in the saved
cwds; scrollback/running programs are gone).

**But PTYs survive a renderer reload (sleep/dev-HMR/GPU-crash).** PTYs live in the main
process, which outlives a renderer reload. `pty:spawn` is **attach-or-spawn**: a spawn
for an already-live session id **reattaches** — main rebinds output to the new renderer,
resizes, and replays recent history from a bounded per-session `OutputBuffer` — instead
of respawning and orphaning the live shell. Diagnosed via `electron/diagnostics.ts`
(a lid-close showed suspend→resume with no app reboot, only a renderer reload). Explicit
`pty:kill` (pane/tab close) still truly terminates + frees the buffer.

**True reattach across a full app quit** (live processes surviving a quit, via a detached
daemon) is still **ROADMAP M5** — a full quit kills PTYs (they're children of main +
`killAllPtys()`). See ARCHITECTURE Appendix A.

**Quit is guarded.** `before-quit` shows a native confirm dialog when PTYs are live
(unless `settings.confirmQuit` is false); the frameless close button routes through
`app.quit()` too. The dialog's "don't warn again" writes `confirmQuit:false` to
settings.json.

## zsh/bash history is shared across panes (cmux-like) {#history}

**Fixed 2026-07-10.** Symptom was: unlike cmux, minmux panes didn't share command history
live (type in pane A, reuse in pane B) and history often didn't survive closing the app —
even with the user's `HISTFILE`/`HISTSIZE`/`SAVEHIST` set (so `.zshrc` **was** loading;
never an rc-loading problem). Root cause: our injected integration didn't enable shared
history, while cmux does (confirmed — `setopt | grep -i sharehistory` returns `sharehistory`
in a cmux pane with the user's `.zshrc` having it off, so cmux enables it itself).

**Fix (in `electron/shell-integration.ts`):**

- **zsh:** after sourcing the user's `.zshrc` (so it wins), `setopt SHARE_HISTORY` + sane
  `HISTFILE`/`SAVEHIST`/`HISTSIZE` fallbacks **only when unset**.
- **bash:** `shopt -s histappend` + `history -a; history -n` in `__minmux_precmd` (after
  `local ret=$?` so it can't clobber the reported exit code).
- **Why it also fixes persistence:** `SHARE_HISTORY`/`histappend` write each command to
  `HISTFILE` **immediately**, so history survives even the hard `proc.kill()` on close — we
  did **not** need to touch the PTY kill/reattach lifecycle (which session-survival depends
  on). Graceful shutdown would be a nice-to-have but is unnecessary for history.
- **Opt-out:** it's an opinionated semantics change (cross-pane chronological interleave vs
  per-session order), so it's gated on `MINMUX_SHARE_HISTORY` (default on). The
  `shareHistory` setting (schema, default `true`) → `main.ts` sets `MINMUX_SHARE_HISTORY=0`
  in the spawn env when off; `wslInjection` lists the var in `$WSLENV` so the opt-out
  crosses into WSL.
- **Invariant:** all panes must keep the **same `HISTFILE`** — the injection must never set
  a per-pane histfile, or sharing breaks.
- **ZDOTDIR poisons `HISTFILE` (fixed 2026-07-15).** We inject `ZDOTDIR=<temp>` to load our
  rc, but a **system zshrc runs before our rc** and (macOS `/etc/zshrc`, some Linux) does
  `HISTFILE=${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zsh_history` — pointing `HISTFILE` into our **temp** dir.
  Result: minmux panes shared history **with each other** (same temp file) but were **siloed
  from every other terminal** (vscode/cmux/Terminal, which use `$HOME/.zsh_history`). Fix: our
  rc repoints `HISTFILE` whenever it landed **inside** our injected dir (`"$HISTFILE" ==
"$MINMUX_ZDOTDIR"/*`, guarded by `-n "$MINMUX_ZDOTDIR"`), keeping the basename →
  `${MINMUX_USER_ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/${HISTFILE:t}` (so it matches whatever file other terminals
  use; never a `HISTFILE` the user set elsewhere on purpose). Runs even when shared-history is
  opted out — a file-location correctness fix, not a sharing opt-in. **Cross-platform:** local
  zsh (macOS/Linux) sets `MINMUX_ZDOTDIR` via `buildInjection`; **WSL** sets it in
  `wslInjection` and forwards it over `$WSLENV`, so the repoint fires there too. bash is
  unaffected (no ZDOTDIR).

## Profiles: a dev build is its own app {#profiles}

An unpackaged build (`make run`) runs as the **`dev` profile**; the installed app keeps the
plain `minmux` names. A profile owns every piece of per-instance state:

- **Electron user-data dir** (`~/Library/Application Support/minmux-dev`, `%APPDATA%\minmux-dev`,
  `~/.config/minmux-dev` on Linux): the **single-instance lock** and localStorage.
- **Config dir** (`~/.config/minmux-dev`, `%APPDATA%\minmux-dev`): settings, workspace,
  Claude hook files and ledger, diagnostics.
- **Shell-integration dir** (`$TMPDIR/minmux-dev/shell-integration`): rewritten on every
  spawn, so a shared one would feed an installed app's new shells another branch's scripts
  (or a half-written `.zshrc`).

Without this, `make run` found the installed app's lock, focused that window and quit — and
had it started, it would have overwritten the installed app's workspace and
`claude-hooks.json` (the ECONNREFUSED hook spam the lock exists to prevent).

- `--profile=<name>` (lowercase, digits, `-`; the `=` is required — Chromium's switch syntax)
  picks a profile for either build. **`MINMUX_PROFILE` works for a dev build only**: an
  installed app ignores ambient env, so an export meant for dev runs can never move it.
  `default` / `prod` is the installed app's. An **invalid** name stops main synchronously
  (stderr + an error box on macOS/Windows; Linux has no dialog before ready) before any name,
  path or lock is set, so it never falls back to some profile's real data. Resolved once, first thing in
  `main.ts` (`electron/profile.ts`), before any path is read.
- **A parent minmux's per-pane env is scrubbed at startup** (`MINMUX_CLAUDE_SETTINGS`,
  `MINMUX_PANE_ID`, `MINMUX_PROFILE`, …): a dev build launched from an installed pane must
  not report Claude events into the installed app's hook dir, and nothing we spawn (shells,
  editors, git) inherits our profile.
- **The app was called smterm** (renamed after v0.1.42). A profile's first minmux launch
  copies its state from the old `smterm[-<profile>]` config and user-data dirs
  (`electron/legacy-migrate.ts`: settings, workspace, resume ledger, window-bg, Local Storage;
  never caches or locks), entry by entry and never over a file the new dir already has, then
  drops a `.migrated-from-smterm` marker. It runs at `ready`, before anything reads those files,
  and **never from a running smterm** (its SingletonLock is live): its ledger would resume its
  Claude sessions twice, so main asks to quit it or to start without it. A failed entry is
  logged and starts fresh. The old dirs stay for an older build. `index.html`'s pre-paint
  script copies `smterm*` localStorage keys once. Env vars are now `MINMUX_*`: the scrub also
  drops the old `SMTERM_*` per-pane vars, and a dev build still honours `SMTERM_PROFILE`, but
  user rc files testing `$SMTERM_PANE_ID` / `$SMTERM_SHELL_INTEGRATION` need the new names.
- The Windows AppUserModelId stays `com.minmux.app` for every profile: toasts only show for
  an id a Start Menu shortcut registers.
- An explicit `--user-data-dir` (the `run-minmux` driver) still wins; the driver sets
  `MINMUX_PROFILE=default` (its HOME is throwaway) unless given `profile`, **and a scratch
  `TMPDIR`**: the shell-integration dir lives there, and the real one is the installed app's.
- The login-shell env import (packaged builds) re-adds any var we lack, so the scrub runs
  again after it. `ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL` is read once (honoured only unpackaged) and
  deleted from `process.env`, so no child — shell, editor, git — inherits it.
- On macOS Electron's `appData` is the real `~/Library/Application Support` even under a
  fake `$HOME`: a test that fakes HOME must still pass `--user-data-dir`.

## node-pty is a native module {#node-pty}

After install / Electron upgrades run `npx electron-rebuild -o node-pty` (in
`make install`). Vitest can't load it (Electron ABI), so PTY spawning isn't unit-tested
there — push logic into pure modules (`output-buffer`, `coalescer`, shell-integration
parsers) and test those; verify the PTY path manually / via the diagnostics log.

**Quit must wait for every PTY's exit.** node-pty reports a child's exit from a background
thread back into JS; if that lands while Electron is tearing Node down, node-pty throws a C++
exception nobody catches → `abort()` (a SIGABRT crash report on ⌘Q). `before-quit` holds the
quit and drains `livePtys` — every node-pty not yet exited, closed panes still winding down
included (`pty-drain.ts`: SIGHUP, SIGKILL after 1.5 s; Windows: no signals + a 300 ms settle;
always resolves), refusing new spawns meanwhile. The decision is the pure, tested
`quit-plan.ts`. Two exceptions: an OS logout/restart (powerMonitor `shutdown`) is **not** held
— macOS would report "minmux cancelled restart" — so it kills without waiting; and the shutdown
event itself never drains (it can be cancelled; the app must stay usable). Known gap: a
Windows logoff that skips `before-quit`.

## GUI launch has a bare PATH — import the login-shell env {#shell-env}

A macOS/Linux app launched from Finder/Dock inherits a minimal `launchd` PATH
(`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`), **not** the user's shell PATH — so Homebrew/cargo
tools (`starship`, etc.) are missing and `.zshrc` lines like `starship init` fail with
"command not found". Only bites the **packaged** app; `npm run dev` is launched from a
terminal that already has the full env. Fix (`electron/shell-env.ts`, VS Code's approach):
on startup, when `app.isPackaged` and not Windows, run the login+interactive shell once,
capture its env, and import PATH (+ missing vars) into `process.env` before any PTY
spawns. Parser is pure + tested; the shell probe is best-effort (returns `{}` on failure).

## Windows {#windows}

The app spawns `wsl.exe` as a shell — it never runs _inside_ WSL.

**Git for a WSL session runs _inside_ the distro, not on the host.** A WSL pane's cwd
(from OSC 7) is a Linux path (`/home/you/repo`) the Windows host can't see, so host `git`
reports "not a git repo" and the diff panel is empty. Fix: the renderer passes the session's
WSL context (`lib/wsl.ts` `wslContext` → `{ distro }`, parsed from the `wsl.exe -d <distro>`
command) with `git:status`/`git:diff`; `electron/git.ts` then runs `wsl.exe [-d <distro>]
--cd <cwd> -- git …` (see `wslGitArgs`). The untracked-file line-count fallback (`countLines`,
host fs) and the diff null-device (`NUL` vs `/dev/null`) are also WSL-aware.

## Clickable file links {#file-links}

Path-like tokens in output are made clickable (click → open in editor / reveal). A **plain click**
opens in normal output, but while a full-screen TUI holds **mouse tracking** (Claude's live UI, vim
— `term.modes.mouseTrackingMode`) a bare click belongs to the app, so there it needs **Cmd/Ctrl-click**
(same as VS Code) — otherwise clicks inside the agent's UI would get hijacked into opening files.
Detection is a **permissive regex on purpose** (`lib/file-links.ts`, pure + tested) — the real false-positive
filter is **existence validation** (`fs:path-exists`, `main`) against the session cwd, so a version
string like `1.2.3` or a domain that doesn't resolve to a file never underlines. Validation is
cached in `terminal-manager` (the link provider fires on hover, not per render). Clicking runs the
`openPath` template (default `code -g {file}:{line}:{col}`, found via the login-shell PATH from
`shell-env` so a packaged app can locate `code`); it falls back to the OS default (`shell.openPath`)
when the template is empty or the editor binary isn't found. **Known limits (follow-ups):** single
row only (a path wrapped across rows isn't matched); forward-slash paths (no Windows-native
backslash); extensionless files (`Makefile`) unless they contain a slash; **WSL** panes don't open
links yet (needs the WSL cwd context — see `#windows` / the WSL git PR).

## Hidden terminals are parked, not hidden {#hidden-terminals}

A pane holds several terminals (surfaces) but mounts only the visible one. Every other
**started** terminal — a hidden surface, a background tab you've visited — is **parked**: its
xterm is opened inside an off-screen, `inert` element in the document (`parkingLot()` in
`terminal-manager.ts`). `detach()` parks; `attach()` moves the host back; `ensureRunning()`
starts a pane's hidden surfaces straight into the lot. The invariant: **once started, a
terminal is mounted or parked — never unopened**, and never disposed on unmount (only when its
session leaves the store).

Starting is **lazy per tab**: only the active tab's `PaneLayout` renders, so after a restore or
a renderer reload a background tab's terminals have no xterm entry (and, after a full quit, no
PTY) until the tab is first shown — no status, notifications or cwd from them before that.
Code must tolerate a missing entry (e.g. `dispose()` still kills the PTY by id).

Why not the obvious alternatives:

- **Unopened until shown** (the first design): an unopened xterm has no theme service, so it
  never answers OSC 10/11 colour queries (agents pick the wrong light/dark), and
  `registerCharacterJoiner` throws "Terminal must be opened first" — with ligatures on, any
  settings change crashed the app.
- **`visibility:hidden` inside the pane:** xterm pauses rendering via an IntersectionObserver,
  which ignores `visibility`, so every hidden terminal would keep painting its output — a
  hot-path cost per surface. Off-viewport parking gets the pause for free.

Parked terminals can't measure themselves: they take their pane's grid via `followSize`
(`syncHiddenSizes` on pane resize / font change), resizing the PTY only when the grid really
changes. WebGL is never acquired while parked (`acquireWebgl` checks the host's parent) — a live
canvas that gets reparented can lose its context. Keyboard focus follows the store's focus:
`attach()` only focuses the tab's focused session, never whatever just mounted.

## Theme on first paint {#first-paint-theme}

`settings.json` loads asynchronously, but a light theme must not flash the dark CSS defaults.
Three pieces, all needed:

1. **`index.html` inline script** applies the last theme's CSS vars (localStorage
   `minmux:theme-vars`, written by `applyThemeVars`) before first paint. Doing it in
   `main.tsx` is too late — module scripts are deferred.
2. **The theme effect waits for `settingsLoaded`** — running once with defaults would
   overwrite the cache with dark. Settings also load _before_ the workspace restore, so
   restored panes spawn with the right `COLORFGBG`.
3. **The native window background** (`window:set-background`) follows the theme and is saved to
   `window-bg` in the config dir, so the next launch's `BrowserWindow` opens light.

A running shell's env can't change, so `COLORFGBG` is stale for panes opened before a
light/dark switch (incl. `appearance: "system"` following the OS); native shells get the live
answer via xterm's OSC 11 reply.

## Agent integrations read internal formats {#claude-transcript}

Hook payloads and the session transcript JSONL are **undocumented Claude internals** — parse
best-effort and ignore what you don't recognize; never throw (`transcript-fold.ts` and friends).
The same holds for Codex's rollouts and `session_index.jsonl` and for OpenCode's bus events
(#codex, #opencode). Each agent's parsing lives in its adapter under `electron/agents/`.

- `/color` and `/rename` are recorded **only** in the transcript
  (`{"type":"agent-color","agentColor":"orange"}`, `{"type":"custom-title","customTitle":"…"}`,
  latest wins, `default` = reset). Claude sends no terminal escape for either, and **slash
  commands fire no hook** — `agent-meta.ts` finds the transcript via the pane's hook events,
  then `fs.watch`es that one file. `/rename` never sets a colour in Claude itself; the
  name-derived colour is minmux's (cmux does the same).
- The transcript is read incrementally in bounded chunks (`TranscriptFold`) — a resumed session
  can be 90 MB+, and a synchronous parse would stall PTY forwarding.
- Hook-event drops are ingested **unordered**: a late `SessionEnd` of the previous session in a
  pane must not stop tracking the new one (compare the transcript path).

## Resuming agent sessions on relaunch {#resume}

`electron/agent-sessions.ts` keeps a ledger (`agent-sessions.json`) of which Claude session
each terminal is inside, from the `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` hooks. On relaunch the
renderer asks for a plan **before** restoring the workspace (so the shell spawns in the
session's own cwd — `claude --resume <id>` only finds transcripts of the current project dir),
and `terminal-manager` types `claude --resume <id> [--permission-mode m]` at the first prompt.

- **Any `SessionEnd` while minmux runs clears the entry** — double Ctrl-C can report reason
  `other`, so reasons can't tell "user quit Claude" from anything else. Only a quit (the ledger
  is **frozen and flushed before** `killAllPtys`, whose kills would fire SessionEnds) or a
  crash (no SessionEnd at all; the ledger is write-through) leaves entries to resume.
- **Live PTYs are skipped** — after a renderer reload Claude is still running.
- **One shot:** the entry is consumed on **failure or dismiss** — not when typed (a quit or
  crash during the confirmation window must still resume next time); a failure shows the
  banner, never a retry loop. Main only consumes the exact carried-over entry, so a late
  success that re-recorded it this run is kept. Failure = a `D` that follows our command's own `C` (it exited — the code is in the
  `D` payload; a `D` without a `C` is just the shell's first prompt arriving late) before
  the agent's `SessionStart`, or 25 s passing with the command no longer running. Still running
  at 25 s (the agent is on a screen of its own: an update offer, a trust prompt) is **not** a
  failure: the banner says it's waiting, the entry stays, and a later success still wins.
- The command is typed from **validated** parts only (each agent's own id format, Claude's
  one-word mode): bypassPermissions is dropped unless `resumeBypassPermissions` is on.
- Background tabs start lazily, so their entries wait (across quits) until first shown.
- Only shells that take POSIX quoting get the typed `cd -- '…' &&` (zsh/bash/sh/dash/ksh, WSL);
  fish, pwsh, cmd and others spawn in the session's dir instead. Typing waits for a real
  prompt on shells main reports as integrated (never guessed from the name).
- Known limit: Ctrl-Z a Claude, then start a second one in the same pane — the second is
  treated as nested (not recorded), so a relaunch offers the first. When the second exits, the
  returning prompt also drops the suspended one from the agents board + Claude icon (a prompt
  can't tell which Claude ended); its next hook event brings it back.
- A shell **without** integration (e.g. a cold WSL VM whose injection timed out) can't confirm
  a resume — no hooks, no OSC 133 — so after typing the banner only says it was **sent**; it
  never reports failure or offers buttons that would type into a possibly-running Claude.
- **The resume folder must be where Claude filed the session.** Claude files a session under
  `~/.claude/projects/<cwd with every non-alphanumeric → "-">/`, and `claude --resume` only finds
  it from that folder. A `SessionStart` whose folder doesn't encode to its transcript's project
  dir falls back to the pane's last verified folder that fits (a stray event from an agent's
  scratchpad; `/clear` while Claude sits in a subfolder); with none, the session is still
  recorded as the pane's lead but never resumed — logged as
  `hook-cwd-fallback` / `hook-cwd-rejected`. A later event whose folder does match is followed
  (a session re-filed under a worktree); `plan()` skips a mismatching entry instead of
  `cd`-ing into it (`src/lib/claude-project.ts`).
- **Background agents inherit the pane.** Claude's named agents run as separate `claude`
  processes with our `MINMUX_PANE_ID` + hooks. **One classifier decides the pane's lead: the
  ledger** — while a live lead exists, any other session's `SessionStart` (startup, compact,
  resume) is nested, and stays nested until it ends (an agent outlives its lead); a real switch
  ends the old session first, and `/clear` / `fork` count as one regardless. Codex and OpenCode
  go by process instead: a new session from the leading process is a switch (`/new`, a picked
  session), another process's is nested (MULTI_AGENT.md §4.4). Main rewrites a
  replaced/rejected folder and tags every root event `nested` before forwarding, so the
  renderer's graph (`in`, status bar, panels) and the pane accent follow only the lead — no
  second classifier. Known limits: a lead killed with no `SessionEnd` in a shell without our
  integration (no prompt mark to notice it) keeps leading until the pane closes; and after the
  lead exits, a surviving agent that runs `claude -p` itself looks exactly like the user starting
  a new `claude` there, so it can lead.
  Session lifecycle hooks are traced as `hook …` lines in `diagnostics.log`.
- Known limit: vi-mode users in **normal** mode — ^U doesn't clear the line there, so a banner
  button's keystrokes are read as vi commands. Stay in insert mode (the default) to use them.
- **rc-time commands are fine** (`conda activate`, nvm, direnv in `.zshrc`): the first `D` only
  comes after the whole rc ran, so the resume runs inside that environment. Two known limits:
  an rc that hands the terminal over (`exec tmux`, `exec fish`, auto-ssh) never shows our
  prompt, so after 20 s the banner only offers Resume (it won't type into tmux); and only the
  session's **folder** is restored, not its **environment** — a hand-run `conda activate ml` /
  venv comes back as whatever the rc activates (could record `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` /
  `VIRTUAL_ENV` from the hook process's env, if it ever matters).
- **Per agent** (its `SessionRules` in `electron/agents/`): Claude types `claude --resume <id>`
  and confirms with its SessionStart. Codex types `codex resume <id>`; its session only starts
  with the first message, so at 25 s the banner says it's waiting for one. OpenCode types
  `opencode --session <id>`, and the plugin confirms at once from OpenCode's own lookup of
  that session (#opencode). Each agent has its own ledger file (`agent-sessions.<kind>.json`;
  Claude's is `agent-sessions.json`, with a marker an older build drops).
- **Delivery by typing is deliberate — revisit only if a shell becomes a pain point.**
  Alternatives weighed (2026-09): (a) the integration runs `MINMUX_RESUME_ID` at the first
  prompt — nothing typed, but native only on zsh; (b) spawn the pane as
  `$SHELL -ic 'claude --resume X; exec $SHELL -i'` — no typing, fixes fish/pwsh quoting, but
  the rc runs twice, no history entry, weaker job control, and no prompt marks to detect a
  failed resume; (c) `claude --continue` — picks the wrong session when two panes share a
  repo. None handles an rc that execs tmux. If fish/pwsh users hit problems, (b) per shell
  is the candidate.

## Codex {#codex}

Codex runs our hooks from `-c hooks.<Event>=[…]` overrides that a `codex` shell function in the
rc tail adds (arguments read one per line from `<config>/agents/codex-args`, so quotes and
spaces survive). They add to the user's own hooks. That function is the only arming, so Codex
is wired in zsh and bash panes only (fish, pwsh or sh: a plain Codex).

- **Hooks need a one-time approval inside Codex** (`/hooks`, then `t`). Codex keeps a trust hash
  per hook definition in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`; minmux computes the same hash
  (`codexTrustHashes`, pinned by a test against a hash Codex wrote) to know whether they're
  approved, and only then stays quiet. Until then a strip in the pane offers to copy `/hooks`.
  The hash covers the hook's command (with the absolute path of our drop script, so each
  profile, a dev build and the installed app, is approved separately), its timeout and event:
  a minmux update that changes any of them asks for the approval again.
- **The hook command is `exec node <drop.cjs> codex`.** The `exec` makes the drop's
  `process.ppid` Codex itself, which the lead rule and the process check rely on (#agent-liveness).
  A test pins the `exec`; a wrapper in between would break both.
- The wrapper prints a display-only launch marker (OSC 6974) for Codex's interactive UI only,
  never for `exec`, `login` or `--version`, and never into a pipe.
- Not armed on Windows or in WSL panes yet, nor when `node` isn't on PATH.
- Thread names come from `<codex home>/session_index.jsonl`, read once for every pane (each
  pane still has its own `fs.watch` on it).
  Codex writes the first name itself; a later different name is the user's `/rename`.
  Tokens come from the rollout's `token_count` events.

## OpenCode {#opencode}

minmux writes a plugin (`<config>/agents/minmux-opencode.js`, source in
`electron/agents/opencode-plugin.ts`) and adds it to `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`. The plugin runs
inside OpenCode and writes its own drops.

- **The user's own `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` is kept.** Main merges ours into it (JSON), and an
  `opencode` shell function merges again at launch in case the rc or direnv replaced it.
  A config that isn't plain JSON is left alone (OpenCode then runs without minmux). A minmux
  started from a pane takes the parent's plugin out at startup.
- **The plugin source is a `String.raw` template:** no backticks and no `${` inside it.
- **It runs inside OpenCode's loop:** filter first, never await, keep maps bounded. Handlers
  measured at p99 ≈ 0.1–0.16 ms over ~200 calls of a real turn (PR #100, #103). One copy per process (another minmux's stays quiet).
- **OpenCode fires nothing on quit.** Its sessions end through the process check
  (#agent-liveness) or the prompt mark.
- **Sub-agents are child sessions** (`parentID`); drops name their root, so the board can nest
  them under their parent. A child whose chain the plugin can't name is dropped, never shown
  as a root.
- **Who named a session:** OpenCode only writes its own title while a session still has the
  `New session - …` placeholder, after its first prompt. Any other change is the user's
  `/rename` and colours the pane. Whether a name is the user's is kept per session in
  `agent-names.json`. Known limit: a rename in the moment before OpenCode's own title (or when
  that title never comes) reads as OpenCode's.
- **Resume:** `MINMUX_RESUME_SESSION=<id> opencode --session <id>`. The TUI's plugin worker
  doesn't see `--session` in its argv, hence the env. The plugin asks OpenCode
  (`client.session.get`) and starts the session at once if it exists; a bad id exits 1
  ("Session not found"). The `opencode` wrapper unsets the variable before it runs OpenCode and
  passes it to that one run only (a `K=V` before a function stays set in bash's POSIX mode),
  and the plugin deletes it from its own env.
- `/new` ends the session it left once that one is idle. Picking a session in `/sessions` sends
  nothing until its next prompt.
- Not integrated on Windows yet (a Windows path in a `file:` URL is unverified).

## Sessions that end with their process {#agent-liveness}

`electron/agent-liveness.ts`. OpenCode sends nothing on quit, and fish and pwsh send no prompt
mark, so a session could stay on the board and keep leading its pane. For agents whose events
carry the agent's own pid (`liveByPid`: Codex, OpenCode; never Claude, whose pid is a hook
shell's), main tracks each root session per process and sends its `SessionEnd` once the
process is gone: every 3 s while anything is tracked, and before folding a batch that starts a
session. For 10 s after a reap, a drop from that pid is ignored if it names one of its sessions,
or any drop while the pid is still dead (a `/new` right before the quit). A new process that
reuses the pid is alive, so its events count. Not on Windows (WSL pids are the
distro's).

## SSH panes {#ssh}

- **A remote session never has a local cwd.** Its OSC 7 path is on the host, so the store
  ignores it and `useActiveWorkCwd` returns nothing for it; the Changes/Files panels show a
  notice instead of reading a local folder with the same name. Don't "fix" an SSH pane's
  missing cwd — that would point git or readdir at the wrong machine.
- **Main rebuilds the command.** Never trust `remote.target` from the renderer (or
  workspace.json); `trustedRemote` looks the host id up in main's list. A saved host this
  build can't read restores as "unavailable" and is written back unchanged.
- **The WSL path skips our shell integration** (`wsl.exe … -e ssh`, no `--rcfile`).
- **One spawn per pane; typed-ahead keys are dropped** while the plan is built, and while a
  pane is waiting/closed/failed only a bare Enter does anything (it reconnects).
- **`remoteCwd` is display only, and per connection.** It comes from what the host prints
  (OSC 7, else the Ubuntu-style title) and is never `cwd`, so no local panel reads a remote
  path; a new connection clears it. **Nothing derived from it is ever sent to the host**: an
  automatic `cd` on reconnect was built and removed, because anything printed in a pane can
  fake an OSC 7 or a title (reviews found injections under fish and cmd.exe, and a trust issue
  with `.envrc`-style hooks). Reopening a folder waits for a trustworthy source (phase 3 shell
  integration) or tmux (phase 2).
- **An integrated ssh pane trusts only nonce-tagged reports** (`OSC 6973;<nonce>;…`, parsed by
  `lib/remote-reports.ts`; the folder is hex of `$PWD`, never a URL). Main pushes the nonce
  (`pty:nonce:<id>`) only after the host's `ok`, and before a reattach's replay. Once a tagged
  report has come, untagged OSC 7 / 133 and titles are ignored at our shell's prompt, and shown
  but never verified while a command it started runs (`exec zsh`, `sudo -i`: see `untrusted()`
  in terminal-manager). `remoteCwdVerified` marks a folder from a tagged report: the only kind
  that may ever be reopened.
- **Only a verified folder is ever reopened, and never through the command line.** A pane's
  `reopenCwd` (a split's source's verified folder, a relaunch's saved one; `lib/remote-reports`
  `reopenFor`) goes to main in `pty:spawn`, is validated again there, and travels hex-encoded
  in the handshake answer (`minmux:<nonce>:<host label>:<hex>`). The host's `sh` decodes it
  with arithmetic, drops it on another machine (`uname -n`), and the user's shell `builtin cd`s
  after its own startup files. A plain host never gets it: the "nothing derived from a
  display-only folder is sent" rule above still holds for everything unverified.
- **Reconnect reuses the session id.** terminal-manager wires xterm listeners once per
  entry and only re-requests the PTY; a second `term.onData` would send every key twice.
- **`attachOnly`** exists for `restore: "on-focus"`: reattach a live PTY after a reload, but
  start nothing. Without it a reload would either dial every host again or strand a live one.
  Under `auto` a restored pane always spawns, so a renderer reload also redials a pane that
  was sitting at a closed/failed prompt (main has no PTY for it to reattach) — by design.
- **The sidebar's connected dot means `remotePhase === "live"`**: a pane still dialing, at a
  Connect prompt, or in a background tab that hasn't started doesn't light it.
- **A dropped connection resets xterm's modes** (alt screen, mouse, focus, bracketed paste,
  cursor keys) before the banner: the remote `precmd` mouse reset never runs locally.

## Agent-status reducer has a known flaw {#agent-status}

`lib/session-status.ts`: `running` = OSC-133 C..D (process alive) ≠ actively working, so
interactive agents read "running" while waiting, and revisiting a pane can re-notify.
Don't quick-patch it — the planned activity-based + latched rewrite needs a real test
matrix. See ARCHITECTURE §9a + ROADMAP M3.6 Track C.
